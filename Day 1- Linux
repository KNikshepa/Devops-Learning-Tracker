Linux Concepts learnt on 12/03/2025

1. pwd: Project working directory - current working directory in the terminal. /home/ubuntu
2. mkdir foldername: Creates new folder
3. rmdir foldername: Deletes an empty folder

Touch command:

4. touch file.txt : Creates an empty file
5. To add txt in empty file: echo "1st line entered" > f1.txt
6. To view entered text: cat f1.txt
7. This command prints the text in second line without overrding it >> : echo "2nd line entered" >> f1.txt
8. This command deletes existing txt which means it overrides the previous text: echo "3rd line entered" > f1.txt
touch f1.txt f2.txt -> Create multiple files

nano command:

9. nano f2.txt
Window will open : type the text, click on ctrl + x, Y to save or N to ignore the text typed.
Delete one line: ctrl+k
Delete all lines: ctrl + a-> ctrl+k

vi or vim command:
10. vim f3.txt
Press I to enter text
Press esc
:wq to save and exit
:q! to just exit without save
dd -> deletes single line
:%d -> all lines

11. ls -> Lists all the directories and files
12. ls -l
-rw-rw-r-- 1 ubuntu ubuntu   17 Mar 12 13:46 f1.txt
File permissions (e.g., -rw-rw-r--)
Number of hard links (e.g., 1)
Owner (e.g., ubuntu)
Group (e.g., ubuntu)
File size (e.g., 17 bytes)
Timestamp (e.g., Mar 12 13:46)
File name (e.g., f1.txt)
13. ls -ltr: sorted by modification time in reverse order (oldest first).

14. cd folder1
2nd way: ubuntu@ip-172-31-89-35:~/folder1$ cd folder5/folder6 (Relative path)
3rd way: cd ../..
4th way:cd /home/ubuntu/folder1/folder5/folder6 (Absolute path)

15. cp copy:
a. cp f1.txt f4copy.txt -> Copying the contents from existing file to new file f4copy.txt
b. In Unbuntu folder, i have 2 folders-> folder1 and folder 3
In ubuntu path: cp -r folder1 folder3
folder1 will be inside the folder3
c. In unbuntu, i have folder1
cp -r folder1 folder2
creates new folder 2 and copies only files in folder1 to newly created folder2
d. Inside folder2: cp -r ../folder1 .
../folder1: Refers to folder1 in the parent directory (one level up from folder2).
.: Refers to the current directory, which in this case is folder2.

16. mv move:
a. file in folder 1 moved to folder2
ubuntu@ip-172-31-89-35:~/folder1$ ls
f1.txt
ubuntu@ip-172-31-89-35:~/folder1$ mv f1.txt ../folder2
ubuntu@ip-172-31-89-35:~/folder1$ 

b. Unbutu folder f3 txt file to folder2
ubuntu@ip-172-31-89-35:~$ touch f3.txt

c. folder file to ubuntu folder
ubuntu@ip-172-31-89-35:~/folder2$ ls
f1.txt  f3.txt
ubuntu@ip-172-31-89-35:~/folder2$ mv f3.txt ..
ubuntu@ip-172-31-89-35:~/folder2$ cd ..
ubuntu@ip-172-31-89-35:~$ mv f3.txt folder2

d. Folder1 f7 txt to folder2
ubuntu@ip-172-31-89-35:~$ mv folder1/f7.txt folder2
ubuntu@ip-172-31-89-35:~$ 

17. Renaming the files or folder: mv
mv f3.txt f3rename.txt
mv folder1 folder1rename

18. rm: Remove files or directories
rm -r folder1rename - Rename the folder
rm f3rename.txt - Rename the file

19. cat: Concatenate and display file content
a. cat f1.txt -> Display the content of the file
b. cat f1.txt f2.txt -> Concatenate the content of 2 files
c. cat > newfile.txt -> Creates new file -> type and then ctrl + D
d. cat >> existingfile.txt -> Append the content to existing file
e. cat file1.txt file2.txt > combined.txt -> Concatenate and save to a new file:
f. cat -n filename.txt -> content with line no

File Permissions & Ownership - We can check the current permission, user or group ls -l
20. chmod: Change file permissions
chmod +x file.txt -> Permission to execute
chmod 777 file.txt -> Read, Write and execute
chmod -w file.txt -> Remove write permission
Permission	Numeric Value	Symbolic Representation
No Permission	0	--- (No read, write, or execute)
Read (r)	4	r--
Write (w)	2	-w-
Execute (x)	1	--x
Read + Write	4 + 2 = 6	rw-
Read + Execute	4 + 1 = 5	r-x
Write + Execute	2 + 1 = 3	-wx
Full Permission (Read + Write + Execute)	4 + 2 + 1 = 7	rwx
Owner, Group and Others
De-rw-rw-r-- 1 ubuntu ubuntu    0 Mar 13 02:25 f1.txt
drwxrwxr-x 2 ubuntu ubuntu 4096 Mar 13 02:25 folder1
rw-	Group has Read (r) + Write (w) permissions, but no Execute (-)

21. chown: Change file owner and group
For this, I have created a new user and group
22. sudo useradd -m newuser3 -> Created new user
23. sudo groupadd newgroup -> Created new group
link the user to group
sudo usermod -aG newgroup newuser3
24. set the password for the newuser3: 
sudo passwd newuser3
